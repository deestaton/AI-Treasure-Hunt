### Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?
The TreasureHuntGame is a pathfinding AI project. In this project, the AI pirate agent must learn the best possible path to find the treasure by using a Deep Q-Learning algorithm. This algorithm allows the pirate agent to find the treasure from any position in the layout. I was given a set of starter code, but I was responsible for creating the actual Q-Training algorithm.

### Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:
* What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
* How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
* What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?

Computer scientists solve complex technical problems and prepare for the future. My approach to a problem as a computer scientist is to first understand the problem. Next, I design a model for a solution and, if successful after testing, I implement that solution to solve the problem. My ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization are to eliminate hidden bias in AI as must as possible.
