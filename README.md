# Emerging and Current Trends in AI

The TreasureHuntGame is a pathfinding AI project. In this project, the AI pirate agent must learn the best possible path to find the treasure by using a Deep Q-Learning algorithm. This algorithm allows the pirate agent to find the treasure from any position in the layout. I was given a set of starter code, but I was responsible for creating the actual Q-Training algorithm.
